# Demo Devops NodeJs

This is a simple application to be used in the technical test of DevOps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.15.0

### Installation

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/devsu/demo-devops-nodejs.git
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

### Database

The database is generated as a file in the main path when the project is first run, and its name is `dev.sqlite`.

Consider giving access permissions to the file for proper functioning.

## Usage

To run tests you can use this command.

```bash
npm run test
```

To run locally the project you can use this command.

```bash
npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:8000/api/users with your browser to see the result.

### Features

These services can perform,

#### Create User

To create a user, the endpoint **/api/users** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: POST
```

```json
{
    "dni": "dni",
    "name": "name"
}
```

If the response is successful, the service will return an HTTP Status 200 and a message with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "dni": "dni",
    "name": "name"
}
```

If the response is unsuccessful, we will receive status 400 and the following message:

```json
{
    "error": "error"
}
```

#### Get Users

To get all users, the endpoint **/api/users** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: GET
```

If the response is successful, the service will return an HTTP Status 200 and a message with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "dni": "dni",
        "name": "name"
    }
]
```

#### Get User

To get an user, the endpoint **/api/users/<id>** must be consumed with the following parameters:

```bash
  Method: GET
```

If the response is successful, the service will return an HTTP Status 200 and a message with the following structure:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "dni": "dni",
    "name": "name"
}
```

If the user id does not exist, we will receive status 404 and the following message:

```json
{
    "error": "User not found: <id>"
}
```

If the response is unsuccessful, we will receive status 400 and the following message:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        "error"
    ]
}
```

### DevOps Project Diagram

The following is the diagram of the devsutestapp project:

![Project Diagram](https://github.com/Guelmis2/devsutestapp/blob/main/Devsutestapp%20Project%20Diagram.png)

1. The number one represents when a developer pushes a code change to the project's GitHub repository.

2. The number two represents the CI/CD process that runs within the Azure DevOps Pipeline.

3. The number three represents the stage within the pipeline that follows the Building and Testing stage and the Code Analysis and Vulnerability Scan. In this stage, the pipeline builds an image using the Dockerfile located in the project's repository and pushes it to the DockerHub Container Registry.

4. The number four represents the stage within the pipeline where the Kubernetes cluster is created on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

5. The number five represents the final stage within the pipeline where the Kubernetes cluster is updated using the manifest file located in the project's repository and the new Docker image previously pushed to DockerHub.


### Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of five stages, each with specific tasks and objectives.

Stage 1: Building and Testing the App
In this stage, NodeJS is installed, and app dependencies are resolved. The program is built, unit tests are executed, and code coverage using Cobertura is performed. The results are published.

Stage 2: Static Code Analysis and Vulnerability Scan
This stage involves using MendBolt (formerly WhiteSource) for vulnerability scanning and SonarCloud for code analysis. Static code analysis and vulnerability scanning tasks are carried out.

Stage 3: Building and Pushing Docker Image
This stage focuses on building a Docker image using the Dockerfile located in the repository. The built image is pushed to a public DockerHub Container Registry.

Stage 4: Creating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is used with Terraform to create an Azure Kubernetes Service. The stage includes initializing Terraform (terraform init) and applying the Terraform configuration (terraform apply) to create the AKS resource.

Stage 5: Deployment of Kubernetes Manifest
In this final stage, the pipeline downloads the Kubernetes manifest from the GitHub repository. It saves the manifest as an artifact and deploys it to the AKS cluster created in the previous step. Additionally, the Nginx Ingress Controller is downloaded and deployed to enable public access to the app via a public IP on port 80.

Overall, the pipeline automates the building, testing, analysis, containerization, AKS provisioning, and Kubernetes deployment processes for the project.
